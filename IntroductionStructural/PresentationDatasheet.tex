\frametitle {Just enough SysML - Presentation datasheet (I/II)}
\begin{block}{}
\textbf{Purpose \& Audience:} providing enough understanding of SysML to a group of architects, so they can read and modify SysML models. It is assumed familiarity with modelling techniques.\newline
\textbf{Duration:} two sessions of 50 minutes.
\end{block}

\textbf{Session 1: Agenda}
\begin{outline}
\1 What is SysML and types of diagrams
%\2 SysML as a language with grammar, syntax and semantics.%Syntactically correct != good model.
\1 SysML application in DeviceHW
\1 Modelling structure
\2 Block Definition Diagrams and Internal Block Diagrams: blocks and compartments, values, parts, generalization, relations and multiplicities. Instances and internal composition of blocks.
\2 Modelling interfaces with Proxy Ports and Full Ports: differences and how to choose. Guidelines.
